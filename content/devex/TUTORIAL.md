## Introduction

{% if MY_NAME %}Hi **{{ MY_NAME }}! 👋** {% endif %}Welcome to DevEx Bootkon. We're delighted to have you! This sidebar contains parts of the labs you will work through. Before we get started, let's set up a few things:

### Working with labs

You can insert commands into the terminal using the following button on top of each code line in the tutorial:
<walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon>. The button will automatically open the terminal.
Please make sure you are using the terminal of the IDE.

Let's try:

```bash
echo "I'm ready to get started."
```

Execute by pressing the return key in the terminal that has been opened in the lower part of your screen.

### Setting environment variables
You can open files directly from this tutorial.
Open `vars.sh` <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="vars.sh">by clicking here</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
and set `GCP_USERNAME`, `PROJECT_ID` according to the information you received. Also let us know your (first?) name in `MY_NAME`. Don't forget to save it.

❗ Please do not include any whitespaces when setting these variablers.

Please reload bootkon and make sure there are no errors printed:

```bash
. bk
```


And restart the tutorial using the next command. You can also use the next command to continue bootkon in case you accidentally close the tutorial or the editor:

```bash
bk-start
```

Now, your

* `PROJECT_ID` is `{% if PROJECT_ID == "" %}None{% else %}{{ PROJECT_ID }}{% endif %}`

* `GCP_USERNAME` is `{% if GCP_USERNAME == "" %}None{% else %}{{ GCP_USERNAME }}{% endif %}`.


If neither is `None`, press the `START` button below to get started!

# Data and AI Boot-Kon

## Introduction

Welcome to Data & AI Bootkon. 

An imaginary company named FraudFix Technologies specializes in enhancing financial transaction security for Google Cloud enterprise customers across industries like finance and e-commerce.

**Your role**: As a senior data analytics/AI engineer at FraudFix Technologies, you will tackle the challenges of making financial transactions safer using machine learning. Your work will involve analyzing vast amounts of transaction data to detect and prevent fraud, as well as assessing customer sentiment regarding the quality of transaction services. You will leverage a unique synthetic dataset, which includes auto-generated data by Google Gemini and a public European credit card transaction dataset that has been PCA transformed and anonymized. This dataset will be used to train your models, reflecting real-world applications of GCP Data & AI in enhancing financial safety.

## Lab 2: Data Ingestion

<walkthrough-tutorial-duration duration="45"></walkthrough-tutorial-duration>
<walkthrough-tutorial-difficulty difficulty="4"></walkthrough-tutorial-difficulty>
<bootkon-cloud-shell-note/>

Original document: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NAcQb9qUZsyGSe2yPQWKrBz18ZRVCL7X9e-NDs5lQbk/edit?usp=drive_link)


During this lab, you ingest fraudulent and non fraudulent transactions dataset into BigQuery using three methods:
* **Method 1**: Using BigLake with data stored in [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs)
* **Method 2**: Near real-time ingestion into BigQuery using [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs)
* **Method 3**: Batch ingestion into BigQuery using [Dataproc Serverless](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs)


For all methods, we are ingesting data from the Google Cloud bucket you have created in the previous lab through `bootstrap.sh`. Feel free to have a look at the contents of this bucket:

### Method 1: External table using BigLake

BigLake tables allow querying structured data in external data stores with access delegation. For an overview, refer to the [BigLake documentation](https://cloud.google.com/biglake/docs). Access delegation decouples access to the BigLake table from access to the underlying data store. An external connection associated with a service account is used to connect to the data store.

Because the service account handles retrieving data from the data store, you only have to grant users access to the BigLake table. This lets you enforce fine-grained security at the table level, including row-level and column-level security. For BigLake tables based on Cloud Storage, you can also use dynamic data masking. To learn more about multi-cloud analytic solutions using BigLake tables with Amazon S3 or Blob Storage data, see BigQuery Omni.

Note that this section could also be done in the Google Cloud Console (the GUI). However, in this lab, we will do it on the command line.

First, we create the connection:
```bash
bq mk --connection --location=$REGION --project_id=$PROJECT_ID \
    --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE fraud-transactions-conn
```

When you create a connection resource, BigQuery creates a unique system service account and associates it with the connection.
```bash
bq show --connection ${PROJECT_ID}.${REGION}.fraud-transactions-conn
```
Note the `serviceAccountID`. It should resemble `connection-...@...gserviceaccount.com`.

To connect to Cloud Storage, you must give the new connection read-only access to Cloud Storage so that BigQuery can access files on behalf of users. Let's assign the service account to a variable:
```bash
CONN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(bq --format=prettyjson show --connection ${PROJECT_ID}.${REGION}.fraud-transactions-conn | jq -r ".cloudResource.serviceAccountId")
echo $CONN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

And grant it access to Cloud Storage:
```bash
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://${PROJECT_ID}-bucket \
--role=roles/storage.objectViewer \
--member=serviceAccount:$CONN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

Next, we create a dataset that our external table will live in:
```bash
bq --location=${REGION} mk -d ml_datasets
```

Go to the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery). check that the dataset has been created successfully (Note: you may need to click "refresh contents" from the 3-dot menu for the project in the Explorer).

Finally, create a table in BigQuery pointing to the data in Cloud Storage:

```bash
bq mk --table \
  --external_table_definition=@PARQUET="gs://${PROJECT_ID}-bucket/bootkon-data/parquet/ulb_fraud_detection/*"@projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${REGION}/connections/fraud-transactions-conn \
  ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_biglake
```

Go to the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) console again and open the dataset and table you just created. Click on `Query` and insert the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM `<walkthrough-project-id/>.ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_biglake` LIMIT 1000;
```

Note that you can also execute a query using the `bq` tool:

```bash
bq --location=$REGION query --nouse_legacy_sql "SELECT Time, V1, Amount, Class FROM <walkthrough-project-id/>.ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_biglake LIMIT 10;"
```

Note that the data we are querying still resides on Cloud Storage and there are no copies stored in BigQuery. Using BigLake, BigQuery acts as query engine but not as storage layer.

### Method 2: Real time data ingestion into BigQuery using Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub enables real-time streaming into BigQuery. Learn more about [Pub/Sub integrations with BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/bigquery).

We create an empty table and then stream data into it. For this to work, we need to specify a schema. Have a look at <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/data_ingestion/fraud_detection_bigquery_schema.json">`fraud_detection_bigquery_schema.json`</walkthrough-editor-open-file>. This is the schema we are going to use.

Create an empty table using this schema:
```bash
bq --location=$REGION mk --table \
<walkthrough-project-id/>:ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_pubsub src/data_ingestion/fraud_detection_bigquery_schema.json
```

We also need to a Pub/Sub schema. We use Apache Avro, as it is better suited for appending row-wise:
```bash
gcloud pubsub schemas create fraud-detection-schema \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID  \
    --type=AVRO \
    --definition-file=src/data_ingestion/fraud_detection_pubsub_schema.json
```

And then create a Pub/Sub topic using this schema:
```bash
gcloud pubsub topics create fraud-detection-topic \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID  \
    --schema=fraud-detection-schema \
    --message-encoding=BINARY
```

We also need to give Pub/Sub permissions to write data to BigQuery. The Pub/Sub service account is created automatically and
is comprised of the project number (not the id) and an identifier. Let's first figure out the number:
```bash
export PROJECT_NUM=$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} --format="value(projectNumber)")
export PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="service-${PROJECT_NUM}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
echo $PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

And grant the service account access to BigQuery:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member=serviceAccount:$PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT --role=roles/bigquery.dataEditor

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member=serviceAccount:$PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT --role=roles/bigquery.jobUser  
```

Next, we create the Pub/Sub subscription:
```bash
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create fraud_detection-subscription \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID  \
    --topic=fraud_detection-topic \
    --bigquery-table=$PROJECT_ID.ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_pubsub \
    --use-topic-schema  
```

Feel free to [check it out in the Pub/Sub console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription).

Since we'll be using Python, let's install the Python <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="requirements.txt">packages</walkthrough-editor-open-file> we want to make use of:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please have a look at <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/data_ingestion/import_csv_to_bigquery_1.py">`import_csv_to_bigquery_1.py`</walkthrough-editor-open-file>. This script loads CSV files from Cloud Storage, parses it in Python, and sends it to Pub/Sub - row by row.

Let's execute it.
```bash
./src/data_ingestion/import_csv_to_bigquery_1.py
```

Each line you see on the screen corresponds to one transaction being sent to Pub/Sub and written to BigQuery. It would take approximately 40 to 60 minutes for it to finish. So, please cancel the command using 'CTRL + C'.

<!-- 
We can make this faster by using different parameters for Pub/Sub. First, remove all rows you just ingested:
```bash
bq --location=$REGION query --nouse_legacy_sql "DELETE FROM <walkthrough-project-id/>.ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_pubsub WHERE true;"
```

Next, have a look at <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/data_ingestion/import_csv_to_bigquery_2.py">import_csv_to_bigquery_2.py</walkthrough-editor-open-file>. Can you make out the difference to the first script? Let's execute it:
```bash
./src/data_ingestion/import_csv_to_bigquery_2.py
```
-->

### Method 3: Ingestion using Cloud Dataproc (Apache Spark)

[Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/overview) is a fully managed and scalable service for running Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Presto, and 30+ open source tools and frameworks. Dataproc allows data to be loaded and also transformed or pre-processed as it is brought in.

Create an empty BigQuery table:
```bash
bq --location=$REGION mk --table \
<walkthrough-project-id/>:ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_dataproc src/data_ingestion/fraud_detection_bigquery_schema.json
```

Open <walkthrough-editor-select-line filePath="src/data_ingestion/import_parquet_to_bigquery.py" startLine="4" endLine="4" startCharacterOffset="14" endCharacterOffset="31">import_parquet_to_bigquery.py</walkthrough-editor-select-line> in the Cloud Shell editor and replace the project id with your project id. Don't forget to save.

Execute it:
```bash
gcloud dataproc batches submit pyspark src/data_ingestion/import_parquet_to_bigquery.py \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID \
    --region=$REGION \
    --deps-bucket=gs://${PROJECT_ID}-bucket
```

While the command is still running, open the [DataProc Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataproc/batches) and monitor the job.

After the Dataproc job completes, confirm that data has been loaded into the BigQuery table. You should see over 200,000 records, but the exact count isn't critical:
```bash
bq --location=$REGION query --nouse_legacy_sql "SELECT count(*) as count FROM <walkthrough-project-id/>.ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection_dataproc;"
```

You've nailed the data ingestion lab -- great job!

   * Click <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="text('create')">CREATE</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
   * The development workspace page appears.  
   * Click on the newly created **hackathon-YOURLASTNAME-workspace** 

   Click <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="[id$=_4rif_initialize-workspace-button]">INITIALIZE WORKSPACE</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
   
### **Adjust workflow settings and create SQLX files**
Edit `workflow_settings.yaml`file :

  Replace **defaultDataset** value with

  ```
  ml_datasets
  ```

  Make sure **defaultProject** value is **your project id** 

  **Note:** Nevermind if you have a different dataform core version, just continue

* Click on <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="text('install packages')">INSTALL PACKAGES</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> ***Only*** ***Once***. You should see a message at the bottom of the page:

  *Package installation succeeded*

Delete the following files from the <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="semantic({treeitem 'Toggle node *definitions more'})">*definitions</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> folder:

`first_view.sqlx`
`second_view.sqlx`

Within <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="semantic({treeitem 'Toggle node *definitions more'})">*definitions</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> create a new directory called `models`:

 <img src= "../img/lab3/newdirectory.png" alt="newdirectory" style="border: 1px solid grey;">

Click on `models` directory and create 2 new files

  ```
  create_dataset.sqlx
  ```
  ```
  llm_model_connection.sqlx
  ```

Example:

 <img src= "../img/lab3/createdataset.png" alt="createdataset" style="border: 1px solid grey;">

Copy the contents to each of those files:

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/dataform/definitions/models/create_dataset.sqlx">`create_dataset`</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/dataform/definitions/models/llm_model_connection.sqlx">`llm_model_connection`</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Click on <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="semantic({treeitem 'Toggle node *definitions more'})">*definitions</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> and create 3 new files: 

  ```
  mview_ulb_fraud_detection.sqlx
  ```
  ```
  sentiment_inference.sqlx
  ```
  ```
  ulb_fraud_detection.sqlx
  ```

Example:

 <img src= "../img/lab3/mview_fraud_detection.png" alt="mview_fraud_detection" style="border: 1px solid grey;">

Copy the contents to each of those files:

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/dataform/definitions/mview_ulb_fraud_detection.sqlx">`mview_ulb_fraud_detection`</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/dataform/definitions/sentiment_inference.sqlx">`sentiment_inference`</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="src/dataform/definitions/ulb_fraud_detection.sqlx">`ulb_fraud_detection`</walkthrough-editor-open-file>


Set the `database` value to your **project ID** value in `ulb_fraud_detection.sqlx` file:

 <img src= "../img/lab3/ulb_fraud_detection_config.png" alt="ulb_fraud_detection_config" style="border: 1px solid grey;">

In `llm_model_connection.sql`, replace the  **'us.llm-connection'** connection with the connection name you have created in LAB 2 during the BigLake section.  If you have followed the steps in LAB 2, the connected name should be “**us.fraud-transactions-conn**”

Notice the usage of $ref in line 11, of **definitions/mview\_ulb\_fraud\_detection.sqlx**. The advantages of using $ref in Dataform are

* Automatic Reference Management: Ensures correct fully-qualified names for tables and views, avoiding hardcoding and simplifying environment configuration.  
* Dependency Tracking: Builds a dependency graph, ensuring correct creation order and automatic updates when referenced tables change.  
* Enhanced Maintainability: Supports modular and reusable SQL scripts, making the codebase easier to maintain and less error-prone.

### **Execute Dataform workflows**

### ***LAB Section : Execute the workspace workflow***

For  the sentiment inference step to succeed . You need to grant the external connection service account the Vertex AI user privilege. More details can be found in this [link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/generate-text-tutorial#grant-permissions). You can find the service account ID under **BigQuery Studio \> Your project ID  (example: bootkon-dryrun24ber-886) \> External connections \> fraud-transactions-conn**  
     
<img src= "../img/lab3/externalconnection.png" alt="externalconnection" style="border: 1px solid grey;">  
 <img src= "../img/lab3/serviceaccountconnection.png" alt="serviceaccountconnection" style="border: 1px solid grey;">  

Take note of the service account and grant it the ***Vertex AI User*** role.   
 <img src= "../img/lab3/vertexairole.png" alt="vertexairole" style="border: 1px solid grey;">
     
Back in your Dataform workspace, click **START EXECUTION** from the top menu, then* **“Execute actions”***.  
 <img src= "../img/lab3/startexecution.png" alt="startexecution" style="border: 1px solid grey;">.  

Click on **ALL ACTIONS** Tab then Click on **START EXECUTION**  
 <img src= "../img/lab3/allactionexecute.png" alt="allactionexecute" style="border: 1px solid grey;"> 

Check the execution status. It should be a success.  
Verify the new table **sentiment\_inference** in the **ml\_datasets** dataset in BigQuery.  
Query the BigQuery table content (At this point you should be familiar with running BigQuery SQL)  
   
```bash
SELECT distinct ml_generate_text_llm_result,
prompt,
Feedback
FROM `ml_datasets.sentiment_inference` LIMIT 10;
```
   
**\[Max 2 minutes\]** Discuss the table results within your team group.

Before moving to the challenge section of the Lab, go back to the CODE section of the Dataform workspace. At the top of the “Files” section on the left, click **“Commit X Changes”** (X should be about 7), add a commit message like, “Bootkon Lab 3”, then click “**Commit all files***” and then **“Push to Default Branch”**

 <img src= "../img/lab3/pushtodefault.png" alt="pushtodefault" style="border: 1px solid grey;"> 

You should now have the message   
 <img src= "../img/lab3/workspaceuptodate.png" alt="workspaceuptodate" style="border: 1px solid grey;"> 

### **CHALLENGE Section : Production, Scheduling and Automation** 

Automate and schedule the compilation and execution of the pipeline. This is done using release configurations and workflow configurations.

**Release Configurations:**  
Release configurations allow you to compile your pipeline code at specific intervals that suit your use case. You can define:

* Branch, Tag, or Commit SHA: Specify which version of your code to use.  
* Frequency: Set how often the compilation should occur, such as daily or weekly.  
* Compilation Overrides: Use settings for testing and development, such as running the pipeline in an isolated project or dataset/table.  
    
  Common practice includes setting up release configurations for both test and production environments. For more information, refer to the [release configuration documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataform/docs/release-configurations).  
    
  **Workflow Configurations**  
    
  To execute a pipeline based on your specifications and code structure, you need to set up a workflow configuration. This acts as a scheduler where you define:  
    
* Release Configuration: Choose the release configuration to use.  
* Frequency: Set how often the pipeline should run.  
* Actions to Execute: Specify what actions to perform during each run.

  The pipeline will run at the defined frequency using the compiled code from the specified release configuration. For more information, refer to the [workflow configurations documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataform/docs/workflow-configurations).

*\[TASK\] Challenge : Take up to 10 minutes to Setup a Daily Frequency Execution of the Workflow*


***Goal:*** Set up a daily schedule to automate and execute the workflow you created.

* Automate and schedule the pipeline’s compilation and execution.  
* Define release configurations for one production environment (optionally: you can create another one for dev environment)  
* Set up workflow configurations to schedule pipeline execution (use dataform service account).  
* Set up a 3 minute frequency execution of the workflow you have created.  
     
     
***Note:*** If you are stuck and cannot figure out how to proceed after a few minutes, ask the your team captain.


You've nailed the Dataform lab -- great job!

In this lab, you will create a Vertex AI Workbench Instance and perform machine learning on the data set you previously ingested.

Vertex AI Workbench is a Jupyter notebook-based development environment for the entire data science workflow. You can interact with Vertex AI and other Google Cloud services from within a Vertex AI Workbench instance's Jupyter notebook.

Vertex AI Workbench integrations and features can make it easier to access your data, process data faster, schedule notebook runs, and more.

For example, Vertex AI Workbench lets you:

- Access and explore your data from within a Jupyter notebook by using BigQuery and Cloud Storage integrations.
- Automate recurring updates to your model by using scheduled executions of your notebook's code that run on Vertex AI.
- Process data quickly by running a notebook on a Dataproc cluster.
- Run a notebook as a step in a pipeline by using Vertex AI Pipelines.

You can [create](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/create#gcloud) such an instance either through the UI, or using the following command:

```bash
gcloud workbench instances create bootkon-notebook \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID \
    --location=${REGION}-a \
    --vm-image-project=cloud-notebooks-managed \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-4 \
    --vm-image-name workbench-instances-v20241118 \
    --metadata=post-startup-script=gs://${PROJECT_ID}-bucket/bootstrap_workbench.sh
```

Open the [Vertex AI Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/locations/us-central1-a/instances/bootkon-notebook) and as soon as the instance is ready, click on `OPEN JUPYTERLAB`. The bootkon repository has been automatically cloned using the `post-startup-script` we passed earlier.

Now, please open `notebooks/bootkon_lab4_vertex.ipynb` and continue your journey.

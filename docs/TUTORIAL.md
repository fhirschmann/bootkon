# Data and AI Boot-Kon

## Introduction

Welcome to bootkon. 

An imaginary company named FraudFix Technologies specializes in enhancing financial transaction security for Google Cloud enterprise customers across industries like finance and e-commerce.

**Your role**: As a senior data analytics/AI engineer at FraudFix Technologies, you will tackle the challenges of making financial transactions safer using machine learning.

Your role: As a senior data analytics/AI engineer at an imaginary company called FraudFix Technologies, you will tackle the challenges of making financial transactions safer using machine learning. Your work will involve analyzing vast amounts of transaction data to detect and prevent fraud, as well as assessing customer sentiment regarding the quality of transaction services. You will leverage a unique synthetic dataset, which includes auto-generated data by Google Gemini and a public European credit card transaction dataset that has been PCA transformed and anonymized. This dataset will be used to train your models, reflecting real-world applications of GCP Data & AI in enhancing financial safety.

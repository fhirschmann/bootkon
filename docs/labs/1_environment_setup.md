In this lab we will set up your environment, download the data set for this bootkon, put it to Cloud storage,
and do a few other things.

### **Setup your environment**

Have a look at <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="bootstrap.sh">`bootstrap.sh`</walkthrough-editor-open-file> and what it does; exeucte it:
```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

Well done, your environment is now ready for the first lab!

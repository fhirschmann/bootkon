# Executing code labs

During this event, we will guide you through a series of labs using Google Cloud Shell.

Cloud Shell is a fully interactive, browser-based environment for learning, experimenting, and managing Google Cloud projects. It comes preloaded with the Google Cloud CLI, essential utilities, and a built-in code editor with Cloud Code integration, enabling you to develop, debug, and deploy cloud apps entirely in the cloud.

Simply press the button below to launch Cloud Shell. The lab repository will be cloned automatically, and the tutorial will appear on the right-hand side for easy reference.

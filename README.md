# Bootkon: innovate and build with Google Cloud

Bootkon is an immersive AI augmented hackathon designed for tech enthusiasts, developers, and innovators to explore the power of Google Cloud products through hands-on learning. This event provides a unique, integrated experience using Google Cloud Shell tutorials, enabling participants to dive deep into cutting-edge cloud technologies.

Devex Bootkon consits of the following streams:

| Stream        | Description | Authors        | 
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------- | 
| [Data & AI](content/data/README.md) | Your role: As a senior data analytics/AI engineer at an imaginary company called FraudFix Technologies, you will tackle the challenges of making financial transactions safer using machine learning. Your work will involve analyzing vast amounts of transaction data to detect and prevent fraud, as well as assessing customer sentiment regarding the quality of transaction services. You will leverage a unique dataset, which includes auto-generated data by Google Gemini and  public European credit card transactions that have been PCA transformed and anonymized. This dataset will be used to train your models, reflecting real-world applications of GCP Data & AI in enhancing financial safety. | [Fabian Hirschmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fhirschmann/) (maintainer; main author), [Cary Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cary-edwards-a3a557a6/) (contributor), [Wissem Khlifi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orawiss/) (original author), [Daniel Quinlan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%8C%8Ddaniel-quinlan-51126016/), [Daniel Holgate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielholgate/) |
